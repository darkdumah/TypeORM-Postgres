This is an example of relational database design
using TypeORM library with Typescript and Postges db.

Using a Object-Relational-Mapping method is a useful way
to link your application to a relational database.

You can create and structure the design of your db
tables, restrict data types to be less error prone.

This is just an example of how to use TypeORM to create
tables and define them, using Typescript and OOP and
then add them to a Postges db.
